# About Me
Hi my name is Kai and I am currently a student studying Computer Science set to graduate March 2024. This has been an exciting journey so far learning all sorts of different technologies and tools! 

# Current + Future Goals
My current short term goals are to build out my portfolio website and practicing leetcodes problems on the side. I am learning and building the website using React and Bootstrap. Currently, I am pursuing the goals of becoming either a Frontend or QA Engineer, two paths that I have been ineterested in.
